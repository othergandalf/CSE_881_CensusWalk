# CSE_881_CensusWalk
For use by Graham Diedrich and Anne Jansen on project in CSE 881 at MSU.

I might recommending a preprocessing file ProcesssingData.ipynb and having that setup so you can commit directly to it; I know VSCode is good about that...

Included:

- Jupyter Notebook where data collection (and some processing) occur
- Walkscore dataset
- Census dataset
- full (joined) dataset
